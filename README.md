The Library | CS143 | Group Project
Code authors: Jacob Kai Martin, Jillian Schmitt, Viktor Karatsupa
Our code should be fairly self-explanatory, boot up the console and use the scanner to input your choices to navigate
a library. Return or checkout books as needed, and browse the wide selection of 18 whole books! You can also see that
when a book is checked out, it no longer appears on the available books page, hooray!
